STRUCTURE
=========

Text:
* Online harassment is a big problem.
* Gaming is good because we have good training data. In this article we will use game chats from the popular online video game League of Legends.
* This is an example conversation.
* Let's see how many we can filter out based on a simple word list

Interactive #1:
* Set word list classifier with various thresholds
* Test during the conversation: grey happy/angry faces light up
* A graph where you can see a metric (accuracy?) for each test you do, plus a clear button

Text:
* Machine learning might be better
* The latest state of the art are recurrent neural networks, because they are good at
* What's cool about neural networks is that the neurons take up various functions

Interactive #2:
* A number of example texts (toxic vs nice?) you can go through word by word
* A number of example neurons and how hard they activate at various points

Text:
* You see that at the lowest level the neurons activate on individual words
* The higher levels track the temperature at a higher level
* Important: nobody told the network to do this, it just figured out that this was a good strategy to catch toxic players

Interactive #3:
* Same as interactive #1, but adds second classifier option with threshold

* It might be hard to grasp which is better by just looking at raw numbers, so we added a button so you can see the F-score instead
* You can play with the beta value of the F-score

-- Possible --

Interactive #4:
* 3D visualization T-SNE toxic word embeddings

Text:
* Word embeddings are also cool

Interactive #5:
* Same as interactive #3, but adds word embedding based classifier



QUESTIONS
=========
* Why is BiGRU so much better than LSTM? Because of the Bi or the GRU?
  * Compare moba_bigru to moba_gru, moba_bilstm, moba_bigru_3layer
* Is the difference between the neurons wide enough to be visible, or do they actually all specialize in everything?

EXTRA IDEAS
===========
* If I build my own embedding layer, and add an extra dimension that identifies the percentage of the word that is capitalized, are there any neurons that specialize in capitalization?
* Visualize what area from the embedding space a neuron specializes in
