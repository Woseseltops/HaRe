<h1>Catching cyberbullies in the act with neural networks</h1>

<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Digital harassment is a problem in many corners of the internet. According to a 2016 report '47% of internet users have experienced online harassment or abuse [1], and 27% of all American internet users self-censor what they say online because they are afraid of being harassed. On a similar note, a survey by The Wikimedia Foundation (behind Wikipedia and other things) showed that 38% of the editors had encountered harassment, and over half them said this lowered their motivation to contribute in the future [2]. If we want safe and productive online platforms where users do not chase each other away, something needs to be done.</p>
