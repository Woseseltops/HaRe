TODO
====
Interactive article:
* Train with 3x single direction LSTM, without capitalization, and check that
  * Using self trained word embeddings?

Code
* Fix type hinting
* Visualize module: too much duplicate code
* Add save option for all visualization functions

Ideas to make the model better
==============================
Use toxic embeddings (make sure to not mix up train and test data!)
Separate casing
Do sequences really need to have a fixed length?

Backlog
=======
* Experiment with neural nets:
  * Study best model in Kaggle... what is different from this experiment? https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52557
    * Check: how is it possible that with less data, scores are higher?
    * Combine embeddings

  * See if this best result can be improved by using Ulmfit http://nlp.fast.ai/ or Bert https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270

* Look up: what exactly is ConvoKit?
